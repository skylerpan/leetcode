## Level order
1. Use DFS and multi-vectors to set level order.

## Level traversal 
1.  Vectors's vector needs to process the first vector when vectors is empty.
2.  Use multi-queue with depth as index to group the answer's set.
*  Example 
    ```c++
    for(auto& it : (vector_type_varible)) 
    ```
